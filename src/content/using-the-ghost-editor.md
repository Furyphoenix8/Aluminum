# Physical Properties:

Aluminum is soft, silvery white metal with with a slight blue color in it, and it is very malleable, meaning it can be bent or shaped really easily, and it is very ductile, meanning it can be beaten into thin sheets of aluminum. In Kelvin, it melts at a heat of 933.57 degrees and boils at a heat of 2792 degrees, in Celsius, it melts at a heat of 660.32 degrees and boils at a heat of 2579 degrees, and in Fahrenheit, it melts at a heat of 1220.58 and boils at a heat of 4566 degrees. It is also a good conductor for  heat and electricity.

# Chemical Properties

Aluminum only exists in nature as a compound, mostly as bauxite, which is a mixture of a aluminum, oxygen, and other elements, and it is the main source of it on earth. It reacts with lots of hot acids, it reacts quickly with hot water, and reacts with Alkalis like Sodium hydroxide. It also reacts with oxygen, which it will combine with to createe aluminum oxide in moist air. It mostly resists corrosion because of its oxide coating that protects it, and it is flammable in powder form.
